        <h2>Sophomore in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am a Sophomore at Bob Jones University Visual Studies with a minor in Fashion Design. I work as a nanny part-time.</p>
         <p>
            I enjoy participating life, and I am active in my local church: Gateway Baptist Church of Travelers Rest, SC.  I am a group leader in Sunday School for the College &amp; Career group.  I also drive my lovely ex-roommate to and from church.
         </p> 
         <p>
            I also do not enjoy running / hiking because asthma likes to not let me breathe. However, I do love a good book
